->Dependencies: It requires two external packages/modules, namely colors and express, which are used for styling console output and creating the server, respectively.

->Routes: It imports two sets of routes, adminRoutes and shopRoutes, from separate files (admin.js and shop.js respectively). These routes presumably handle different URLs and HTTP methods for the server.

->Express Setup: It initializes an Express application using const app = express();. Express is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building servers and defining routes.

->Middleware: It uses express.urlencoded() middleware to parse URL-encoded bodies. This middleware is used to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads and is built into Express.

->Routing: It uses app.use() to mount the adminRoutes and shopRoutes at their respective base URLs (/admin and /shop). This means that any routes defined within adminRoutes and shopRoutes will be accessible through these base URLs.

->404 Error Handling: If none of the defined routes match the incoming request, a custom middleware function is used to handle 404 errors. It sends a 'Page not Found!' message with an HTTP status code of 404.

->Server Start: It starts the server on port 3001 using app.listen(3001, callback), and once the server starts running, it logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running on port 3000.
